Improvement we can do

1) I followed the MVVM architecture pattern with kotlin and can easily extend it to clean architecture .
2) Added comments for Utils and view models to make logics clear. please use lass commit to see comments.
3) To store the sensitive data like token use viewmodel but can encrypt and store in secure repo.
